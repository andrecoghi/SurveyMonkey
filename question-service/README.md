# question-service

This MicroService is for crud operations for questions and answers. It uses spring-data-rest-api for it as it takes the sent data and saves how it comes. Please check how to use spring-rest-data-api with one to many relationships and how to create associations between questions and answers by this url:

When this application runs it also creates data for easier testing.
