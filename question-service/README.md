# question-service

This MicroService is to do crud operations for questions and answers. It uses spring-data-rest for crud operations as it takes the sent data and saves how it comes. Please check how to use spring-data-rest with one to many relationships and how to create associations between questions and answers by this url:

When this application runs it also creates data in order to test easier.
